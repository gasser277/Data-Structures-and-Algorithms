Default Dict data structure was used because its more structured and efficient to edit

Add Handler Method:
Time Complexity: O(n) Each part of the path needs to be iterated through
Space Complexity: O(n) A new TrieNode is created for each part

Lookup Method:
Time Complexity: O(n) Each part of the path needs to be iterated through
Space Complexity: O(1) no additional memory used
